However, is something that surprised me that a restaurant with such a good recommendation in history didn't really follow the way the food was served.\nWe did start with the salad but we also had appetizers and main courses so we got the salad.

I made an online reservation, but since it was a Monday, there were plenty of tables available.\nWe ordered several dishes:\nOysters – probably the best we’ve ever had! Very big and fresh.\nMini tartar cones (beef and tuna) – unfortunately, these had no flavor at all, not even salt. The beef ones were slightly sweet because of the cone, which didn’t really work.\nFried anchovies – listed as their “favorite of the month,” but sadly tasteless, even with the sauce that came with them.\nPasta dishes – I had the Tagliolino with honey and truffle, and my husband had the garlic, oil and scampi pasta. We chose them because of the great reviews, but they were both disappointing. The truffles had no aroma or flavor, and overall, neither dish was special.\nDessert (coffee crumble) – this was actually great! We really enjoyed the taste and texture.\nA few other disappointing details: when I made the reservation online, I specifically asked if they could put a candle on my husband’s dessert for his birthday. They asked for my name when we arrived, so I assumed they had seen the note, but they didn’t do anything. Later, I noticed another customer blowing out a candle on their dessert, which made me feel ignored and frustrated.\nAlso, the wine situation wasn’t ideal. They didn’t have the first bottle we asked for, we switched to another one, and in the end, they brought something else entirely “because that’s what they had.”\nOverall, we left disappointed. The service wasn’t terrible, but for a place with such great reviews, we expected much more from both the food and the experience."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhCjeFhAXsokunIVUNtknXQl\u0026fid=0x0:0x7dc4188fea957296""],""When"":""2025-11-4""},{""Name"":""Christina Parrella Grunwald"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUlGqf-c0jv4zDJ2BvienNPH1m5NETTXScjrWFXpWzznb083aGX=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Located just off one of the main shopping strips in Bari… this place was great.

The brand presents itself as a declaration of love for Puglia: “Mordi la Puglia” is their slogan, and every panino, fritto, or specialty served seems to tell a local story made from simple, carefully chosen ingredients. Nothing more original, nothing more authentic: Puglia in a panino – the MastroCiccio Bari experience.\n\nBari has a special kind of energy – a mix of sea air, sunshine, and good vibes, where food is not just nourishment but a way of life. Here, among the old streets and the smell of freshly baked focaccia bread, we discovered MastroCiccio – the place where street food becomes art, and every panino tells a story about Puglia, flavor, and passion.\n\nThe name MastroCiccio hides a story of resilience and determination. It all began as a childhood nickname, linked to the stature of Fabio Mastrandrea – the founder of the brand – but over time, it became a symbol of his personal journey and transformation into a mark of strength and professional success.\n\nFounded in 2002, MastroCiccio has grown steadily, and after more than two decades in the world of fast gastronomy, it has become a benchmark of quality and tradition in the heart of Bari.\n\nAt MastroCiccio, the menu overflows with panini featuring octopus, burrata, panzerotti, seafood sandwiches, and other typical Puglian products – all displayed at the counter, ready to catch your eye before you even sit down.\n\nMemorable flavors between ambiance and crowds\n\nThe star of the show is, of course, U Pulp! – the octopus panino. The octopus was tender and perfectly seasoned, while the bread was crisp on the outside and soft and juicy inside. At the same time, the panzerotto and burrata left their mark with creamy texture and Mediterranean flavor. Although the crowd almost made us give up, every bite proved that the wait was worth it – the intensity and freshness of the dishes make MastroCiccio a stop you simply can’t miss.\n\nAnother dish that caught our eye was the Burrozza Biancorossa – a burrata reinterpreted in a spectacular way: lightly fried until the outside turns golden and crisp while the inside stays soft and velvety. Under the delicate cheese crust lies a flavorful filling of Modena IGP mortadella, basil pesto (without garlic), olive oil, and a touch of pepper. The result is a delicious contrast between creamy and crunchy, between the delicacy of burrata and the boldness of the filling – a true homage to Italian culinary refinement.\n\nAn exotic Panzerotti also drew our attention, and we couldn’t resist trying it. The New Capagnore is a spectacular reinterpretation of Puglian tradition – an explosion of flavors that surprises from the first bite. The black dough, made from Altamura semolina and vegetable charcoal, hides a creamy, aromatic filling: slow-cooked octopus, silky burrata, melted mozzarella, and roasted tomatoes that add a sweet-tangy note. A parsley and anchovy pesto, completed with extra virgin olive oil and a touch of pepper, ties all the flavors together in perfect harmony. A dish that combines visual beauty with refined taste – intense, Mediterranean, and unforgettable.\n\nRaffo beer completed the feast perfectly – smooth, refreshing, and full of local character, making room for the octopus to dance freely.\n\nTips to make the most of your MastroCiccio experience\n• Visit during off-peak hours (after lunch or in the early evening) to avoid long queues.\n• Definitely try the octopus specialties or those featuring local stars like burrata and seafood for the most authentic experience.\n• Eat your sandwich soon after receiving it – it’s best when fresh, and you can always take your photos first.\n• Bring some patience – popularity comes with crowds.\n• At lunchtime, due to the high customer flow, the indoor temperature can rise a bit (perhaps also because of limited air conditioning) and space can feel a little tight."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhANdbF6svYssyYHjMNarRnK\u0026fid=0x0:0x9eb4a306afb7e7da""],""When"":""2025-11-4""},{""Name"":""Enrei Pata"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjVIwyQyrUrUS5oo5MBJN5VJrsbf4318ONTjorI3-QEwxHL7S3sC=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Visited Mastro Ciccio in Bari and totally understand why it’s so famous!

I don’t even know where to start. I was wandering around Bari and needed to kill some time before a certain focaccia shop opened. I don’t know what I’ve done right in this world, but fortune smiled upon me this night. Martinelli was empty so I popped in for a glass of wine while I waited for my focaccia dreams to come true. Well… I never left Martinelli because dreams came true that I hadn’t even had yet. The small and beautifully designed space quickly filled up after I arrived, so again: incredible fortune. Giulia is incredible. The wine she recommended was perfect fit based on what I asked for, and then I started to taste the food. I had to leave Bari the next day, and I had NO idea about the food in this place but now I crave it daily. I had a sandwich with salmon, swordfish, and… something else. Dang! I forget. The sandwich was INCREDIBLE! The wine Giulia recommended to pair was again: perfect. And now I had to taste more. Enter a new face: Shiva. Another incredibly nice and helpful person! They made some dessert tasting platter of heaven, and I took one bite slowly at a time, each with a different flavor: pistachio, peanut butter, white chocolate, dark chocolate, and finally coconut. Between the staff who felt like friends, and the incredible food, chill music, and beautiful space, I was in heaven!\n\nHonestly; I crave this food daily and cannot wait to return to see these wonderful people.

I see why it's part of a foodie tour!\n\nThe phyllo is hand-made, incredible and what makes this the best in town.  Crisp and shatter thin but not delicate where it flakes apart. Not greasy. Not soft and croissant like. The right ratio of spinach, feta and herbs. The Bougatsa is great as well. It comes out of a heated display case piping hot and he'll cut it for you if you eat it there. We bought one to go and carried it to the airport. Three hours later it was still warm with the crispy phyllo!\n\nThe coffees are excellent and his cappuccino is the best we've had as well. Super smooth, creamy and not bitter.\n\nThe owner is friendly and warm. The second time we came, he wished my husband a good day and patted him on the arm in such a nice way.\n\nThere are three bakeries just a couple of doors away from each other on this street. This is the smallest and so low key that you might walk past it but this is the best one.\n\nJust walk on up from Monastiriki Square or down from the Central market and you'll find him.

As a coffee shop, it is undistinguished from hundreds of others in Athens: pleasant, cozy, and enveloped in cigarette smoke.\n\nAs a roastery, it offers a staggering selection of coffee, predominantly from the Americas with a minority from Ethiopia. However, there is virtually nothing from Asia—no Indonesia (not even Java), no Vietnam, and none of the glorious coffee of India. This geographical gap could be excused if the American selection were consistently exceptional. Unfortunately, the sheer breadth of the selection results in a mixed experience. The flavor profiles are hard to decipher, with adjectives that seem drawn from the wild imagination of the roaster on any given day.\n\nThe staff, hurried by customers waiting for their espresso, was unhelpful and could offer little in the way of guidance or advice regarding the beans. To make matters worse, prices are exceptionally high, ranging from €50 to €150 per kilogram. At this price level, experimentation becomes very expensive, very quickly.

I ordered a traditional Greek coffee (metrios — lightly sweet), which they brew the old-fashioned way in hot sand. It was fascinating to watch. The person preparing the coffee was incredibly attentive and meticulous, constantly moving the brass ibrik (briki) through the hot sand so it heated evenly without burning. It took a few minutes, but it was absolutely worth the wait.\nThe coffee itself was bold, rich, and very distinctive — one of the best I’ve had. It was served on a tray in the briki along with a cup and some loukoumi (Turkish delight), which made the whole experience feel very traditional and special. For around €3–€4, I thought it was excellent value.\nThe café has a traditional atmosphere and was quite busy, but it never felt hectic. Locals were sitting inside and outside, slowly enjoying their coffee and conversation. Even though it was busy, there were always a few seats free, the noise level was low, and the staff were very friendly, welcoming, and attentive wherever you sat. It’s also a nice place to grab takeaway, though if you’re in a rush you may want to order filtered coffee since Greek coffee takes a few minutes to prepare.\nThis place is located on Athinas Street near the Central Market in the heart of Athens, and it’s often chosen by local tour guides to introduce visitors to authentic Greek coffee — and after tasting it, I can see why.\nIf you’ve never tried traditional Greek coffee, this is an excellent place to experience it for the first time — and even if you’re a regular coffee drinker, it’s something special."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhDxVunFm_9HleTGNqSj2vXl\u0026fid=0x0:0xd1ce391dd558aa5f""],""When"":""2026-1-6""},{""Name"":""Marie-Soleil Cordeau"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjU6pT3e4bC1h9JkG0_mnqATDAbsCZyq8-4YE97VwpDOW3XwIGZdlQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""For a real Greek coffee experience, this is the place.\nIt’s not cheap, but the coffee is prepared and served in a briki, which we appreciated.\nYou can tell it’s popular with both locals and tourists.\nThere was a small mistake with the sugar level in my son’s coffee, but it was remade right away without any issue.\nYes, I’d recommend this spot."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAefX9BZ7cLfw1YlF5gg8Bm\u0026fid=0x0:0xd1ce391dd558aa5f""],""When"":""2025-12-26""},{""Name"":""Meltem G.

While the coffee is good, you can find similar quality elsewhere if you look so it is a bit pricey. A bit disappointing that the cafe had almost no foam you‘d expect in a good mocca.

Because the taste of the carpaccio was nice, I wanted to save the restaurant on google and on there I saw a review with a picture of a bigger size of carpaccio. I confronted the waiter and after that he brought me a new one, but I had a difficult time enjoying, because I felt scammed. I am still not sure why they first gave me a smaller portion, is it because I am a tourist? If I had gotten the normal portion, I would not have ordered the bread and dip. In the end, I told the waiter that I did not have a nice experience but they did not comped me anything, not even the wine that was 8 euros. I paid 40 euros for a terrible experience and it just did not feel right.\n\nFor such an expensive restaurant I expected more service. I wish I had read the negative reviews of this restaurant before going. I do not recommend this restaurant if you are a tourist.\n\nP.s.

Nothing is too much the Pre starter bread and potato and leek soup on our first visit was a lovely touch as was the continuous supply of water which when it’s 35° you absolutely need the raspberry Coulis  and the free ice cream at the end of the meal all made the experience just a little bit more special\nGreek salad was incredibly fresh and nicely seasoned, but the absolute humdinger is the beef short ribs.\nGo to this restaurant just to have this dish and I promise you will not be  disappointed.\nIt was my son‘s choice. I was gonna go for the lamb but when he said I think Greek salad and beef short ribs that I was sold and it was exceptional. I can only thank the team And the Chef for making it a really special night as always we all ended up talking football with Greek teams and Premier League banter made us feel  incredibly at home and relaxed. This really is a super place to spend the evening drinking cold beer and chatting honestly we are so lucky it’s a stones throw  from our hotel and we will be going back tonight. It was that good.\n\nOK, today is Sunday and we have visited every evening for the last three evenings on Friday evening, My son had the fillet steak black Angus medium rare. I had the moussaka we had a selection of starters see photographs below. Food is exceptionally good hence why we’ve been back now three times but again, I cannot emphasize how important the staff are in this absolutely Wonderful find of a restaurant..\nAnd last night being Saturday, we had spent the day walking around the island of Poros  so we weren’t in the mood to walk very far from the hotel and yet again the guys at Oroscopo outdid themselves with some awesome truffle, ravioli, and chicken skewer\n\nI simply cannot recommend this totally exceptional gem enough get the boys talking about football and you’ll be amongst friends immediately especially if you like Liverpool Man city or Man utd 😆\n\nWe still have five days left of our trip and we will definitely be back again thank you guys for making it such an exceptional part of our evening ."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhD56_x2ZXGGN3RmkMAN167X\u0026fid=0x0:0x68dbe9ba33174a8a""],""When"":""2025-8-1""}]",null,

I’m used to dining at some of the best restaurants in major cities around the world—London, New York, Paris, Dubai, Saint-Tropez, and Mykonos—so I was curious to see if it lived up to the hype.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about the food. It’s good, even very good—I have nothing negative to say about the quality itself. However, when you compare the cuisine with the prices, that’s where the issue lies. For what you pay, you expect something truly outstanding. Taken on its own, the food is enjoyable, but the portions are extremely small—almost like something you’d serve to a 14-year-old. For example, the Greek salad costs €24, with a production cost of maybe €2. Personally, I find that price excessive.\n\nThen comes the service, which I found to be quite poor. I waited 33 minutes for a simple pasta dish with two small pieces of fish. When the waiter tried to tell me it had been “less than 20 minutes,” I showed him the stopwatch I had running—it was clearly over 30.\n\nFinally, the biggest downside for me was the music. It was unbearably loud, making it impossible to have a proper conversation. It felt more like being in a nightclub than in a fine dining restaurant.\n\nSo here’s my recommendation: if you’re going on a date and just want to impress someone, have a drink, or enjoy a small tasting plate, then it’s fine. But if you’re going alone like I did, with friends to talk, or to celebrate something, either be prepared to spend the evening without talking—or simply don’t go.\n\nOverall, I’d give it a 12, maybe 13 out of 20 considering all of the above."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhDMqTCZnXpggTgvVbZ9C5oF\u0026fid=0x0:0x159d90db539a2b0c""],""When"":""2025-10-3""},{""Name"":""Eric Manriquez"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUaiTghG7CTER0fr_NvW0TiMa31T7_Sj_Hx24TcygUBpwmJdMghZA=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":3,""Description"":""Very nice place.

Very attentive with refilling drinks, replacing your plates and silverware, seeing if you have questions/need anything, and checking to see you’re happy with the food.  They even offered to call us a taxi for pickup and walked us out to the taxi when it arrived.\n\nMenu - large variety of drinks to choose from.  The food menu is limited to specific courses for vegetarian and non-vegetarian.  While that may make someone very picky hesitant, read this next section before you let that impact any decisions on making a reservation.  You can pick from a variety number of courses.\n\nFood - A+++\nThey live up to the Michelin star rating with the flavors of the food.   My wife and I are big time foodies and we were very impressed with the amazing flavors of the food.  I personally am not a seafood fan outside of sushi and I really enjoyed the seafood courses.  We did the non-vegetarian 7 course meal and loved it.  Probably our favorite meal while in Greece.\n\nCost - This is a high end restaurant that offers top tier service.  You should expect to spend no less than $100 per person.  $150 per person if you’re getting drinks with the food.  But it’s absolutely worth it in our opinion.\n\nWe highly recommend reserving and enjoying a date night, special celebration, or just a nice and classy dinner at Aleria.

From the moment you step through its gates, you’re greeted by a peaceful hum of laughter and conversation, the kind that only comes from people truly enjoying themselves. It’s the kind of place where time slows down, and every detail invites you to savor the moment.\n\nThe culinary journey at Aleria is nothing short of enchanting. Each course is a masterclass in Greek gastronomy—curated not just to feed, but to awaken. The flavors are bold yet refined, rooted in tradition but elevated with modern finesse. And if you’re wondering whether to choose your own wine, don’t. Trust the sommelier. Their pairings are pure alchemy, creating a seamless dance between plate and glass that heightens every bite and sip.\n\nAs the sun dips below the horizon, the courtyard transforms. Delicate lights twinkle in the trees, fairy-lit ornaments cast a gentle glow, and the entire space feels like a dream woven from warmth and wonder. It’s romantic, serene, and utterly magical.\n\nA special acknowledgment must go to Panos and the entire Aleria team. Their grace, attentiveness, and genuine care elevate the experience from excellent to unforgettable. They don’t just serve—they host, guide, and delight. Let them take the reins. You’ll be glad you did.\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned foodie or simply seeking a place to feel joyfully present, Aleria is a destination worth every moment."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAOXqQLtDvpjoSdpz1sIOQF\u0026fid=0x0:0x1bc52b3e863c34e3""],""When"":""2025-8-23""},{""Name"":""dawgg"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXtL7mAVl5whBmPL4oFECDX73zQR1_pVk0ZKlW_dXXnO2tZLzo=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Ok, let me start with this:  Aleria is NOT a restaurant where you go for a “quick” meal.  Plan to sit and enjoy.  It is truly fine dining, a wine pairing meal that is meant to be savored and allow the wine to seep in so you start talking more ;o) and enjoy the companionship of your party, whether its one other person for five others. On our recent trip to Athens we went because our friend, Effie, said it was a must do.  We were definitely NOT disappointed.  Thank You Effie!!\n\nThe meal unfolded with an amuse bouche and ended several hours later with an equally amazing digestif.  In between we were treated to a dance of amazing flavor combinations and the most sumptuous lamb I have ever had.  Each course and wine were paired perfectly, and we were very pleased that the red was an “Earth and Sky” from northern Greece, a wine we had discovered days earlier in Thessaloniki.  5 courses were perfect for us but you should try 6 or 7 if you skip luncheon.  The Amberjack course was a delightful surprise.\n\nThe staff was knowledgable, unobtrusive and professional, with a sense of humor thrown in.  They made for an amazing evening.  Thank you.  Excellent service is a treasure.\n\nGO NOW BEFORE THEY GET A MICHELIN STAR BECAUSE YOU WON’T BE ABLE TO GET IN ONCE THEY DO.  We’ve eaten at street food vendors to Starred restaurants around the world, this was one of the best.

Of course the sausage in wine had to be included. He surprised me with gorgeous fetta baked in the oven. It was soooo lovely. And the second surprise dish was a great chicken in a creamy sauce dish. All of it was verry, verry tasty. My son took the grilled sausage again and declared it his favorite dish of the whole holiday. My sausage dish topped my own top 5.

We discovered this restaurant walking to another restaurant. Walking through what can only be described with what looks like an alleyway that was brightly lit up with a lot of restaurants and stores, and a very busy walk way that connects a lot of the locals and Taurus to shops and touristy spots such as the Trevi fountain. Outside had a lot of seating. It was beautiful weather. They had a long walkway filled with tables that were full and in front of the entrance, they were tables outside along the walkway, and there was inside seating. The outside was well lit with table lamps, and outside lighting. The front entrance was beautifully decorated with flowers. They had what I would call a restaurant MC someone who is interactive and brings in the crowd and is quick to get guests a seat at this very popular restaurant. The toilets are small, but this seems to be very common in Italy and most don’t have a toilet seat.\n\nThe service was amazing. We knew instantly we wanted to eat at this restaurant as I stated above there’s a gentleman who was there both nights that we went to this restaurant who was quick to greet and get you prepared for a table.  The service was quick. The food arrived quick to the table, and it was hot. The drinks were prompt to come to the table. Most of the employees spoke Italian and English. Everyone was nice but very business oriented and fast. It was a high volume restaurant so everybody was moving quick.\n\nBoth nights we attended the restaurant, we got Aperol spritz and it was the best drinks we had in Rome. My mom got the gnocchi which was perfectly cooked in a meat sauce, and dollop of mozzarella. The roasted potatoes were cooked to perfection. They were soft and seasoned to taste. I ordered Caico e Pepe. It was the best fresh pasta and the right amount of sauce.\n\nWhen you plan your trip to Roma, Italy , you should definitely put this restaurant on your list. I can guarantee that you will not have any regrets. They do accept most credit cards, typically Visa and MasterCard are the most widely accepted in Rome.\nThe menu was in English and Italian.

amazing experience dining at CiPASSO. Will highly recomend to anyone visiting Rome. We booked a table with them for 6 people for a celebration while we were in Rome. They offered us a table in a private setting, which was very nice and suited us really well. The staff were very nice and attentive, checking regularly if everything was okay and to our liking.\n\nThe food was amazing. We had the scallops and crispy eggs as starters, along with a basket of bread. The scallops was a standout for me personally. Then everyone had a pasta for the main course, the parpadelle and duck, lobster linguine and the black truffle tagliolini. Since white truffles were in season we were offered to swap out the black truffles for the white truffles. We opted for that in one of the courses and it certainly did not dissapoint. We also had some wonderful sides and desserts. We all found it hard to pick one favorite since everything was to our liking.\n\nThis is without a doubt my favorite restaurant from our visit to Rome."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhDtoZugu4PueCD_Q5QAlJpO\u0026fid=0x0:0x31aeccf34c0e27fa""],""When"":""2025-10-28""},{""Name"":""Kyung ah Lee"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJAFQQaWjcUPXznrHcIY6N7AsNrOA-DJZXPZL0j36_3aKXc3Q=s120-c-rp-mo-ba3-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We had a wonderful our anniversary dinner there last summer.

The quality hits immediately - they make their own fresh ciabatta, and the fresh ingredients truly elevate the whole experience.\n\n✅ Service \u0026 Experience\n• Staff were warm, friendly, and patient, and actually helpful. We didn’t feel rushed during our meal.\n• They guided us through the menu properly, including drink pairings.\n• They were very allergy-aware, double-checking ingredients for me, which I really appreciated.\n• Overall very welcoming, attentive, and relaxed.\n\n🥪 Food\n• We ordered two vegetarian sandwiches, and both were fantastic. I had Colosseo + partner had Navona\n• They have a strong vegetarian selection, including egg-free options for anyone who needs that.\n• Sandwiches were generous, balanced, and the homemade ciabatta was the star.\n\n🍹 Drinks\n• Aperol Spritz for me - well-made and balanced.\n• White wine for my husband - staff helped us pick.\n\n📍 Location\n• Literally one lane away from the Trevi Fountain - incredibly central and easy to access. Considering the location (usually touristy and overpriced), the pricing feels very fair.\n\n💶 Pricing\n• €1 per person table charge (normal for Rome).\n• Our total was €30 for: 2 sandwiches, 1 Aperol Spritz, 1 white wine\n• For the quality, freshness, and the location, this felt like a good value.\n\n🪑 Seating \u0026 Atmosphere\n• Both indoor and outdoor seating available.\n• We chose outdoor; the space heaters made it warm enough to be comfortable.\n• Indoors looked equally cozy.\n• They have washrooms for customers inside - not the cleanest, but works.\n\nAll in all, a place that nails flavour, service, and value — absolutely worth a visit. Fantastic sandwiches, kind staff, great hospitality, and fair pricing.\n\nHighly recommend.\n\nDescription of our sandwiches from the menu (they had menus in a couple of languages, very helpful!):\n\nFrom their menu\n— COLOSSEO: STRACCIATELLA, EGGPLANTS, DRY TOMATOES, ARUGULA, OLIVE CREAM .......\n€ 7,50\n— NAVONA: PORCINI MUSHROOMS, PARMESAN, TRUFFLE CREAM ......\n€ 8,00"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhDod56jYP99Ryyy8okxM3V4\u0026fid=0x0:0xde60725cbaa29641""],""When"":""2025-11-27""},{""Name"":""Shabnam Jafari"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV_ZZtgvKeDTC6LUWY9GtQzOmpatRQBrKa7vtiz9PXIfEZr-tF7=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""The service was friendly and helpful, and the food was genuinely tasty.

The quality of the ingredients is outstanding — every component is carefully selected, from the artisanal bread to the spreads and cured meats. I especially loved the truffle-based options — rich, flavorful, and beautifully balanced. You can tell that attention to taste and texture is a priority here.\n\nBut what really completes the experience is how well thought-out everything else is:\n– The service is fast, kind, and multilingual (they offer menus in several languages), which makes the space welcoming to everyone, without losing local charm.\n– The atmosphere is casual yet curated: good music, a lively vibe, and a layout that makes you feel comfortable whether you’re dining solo or with others.\n– The wine list is small but well-chosen, with great pairings for the food. And the prices? Incredibly fair — especially considering it’s just steps from the Trevi Fountain, one of the most tourist-heavy areas of Rome.\n\nThis isn’t just a sandwich shop — it’s a reminder that when quality, hospitality, and design come together, even a quick lunch can become a memorable experience.\nHighly recommended — a small gem that gets everything right."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAddwBaZNwUddXRJsl9kqxX\u0026fid=0x0:0xde60725cbaa29641""],""When"":""2025-11-6""},{""Name"":""Ryan Naman"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjX-W3AQT23vRLZuhdYwUdodQJ7-uy7jTcbjDDVgcsP_LLBuTVLN=s120-c-rp-mo-ba5-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Unfortunately and it’s not like me I only have one magical photo from this beautiful meal!\n\nTraveling Italy is an amazing experience, but finding the gems for a stellar meal can make it other worldly!\n\nThe many reviews do this place justice!\n\nGo here!

My cacio e pepe was bland at best. I think they forgot the pepper and only loaded it up with cheese. As for the pasta dish my eldest received (bolognese) this one reminded me of chef I was acquainted with as a child, Chef Boyardee. 4 out of 6 family members tried it and NONE of us could stomach it. It remained uneaten on the table. At a price conversion of nearly $20 USD for that alone, I’d say steer clear.\n\nAlso, if you have been to Europe before you probably know it is not customary to tip, they pay them a real wage and there is a cover charge per person on top of that. Our waiter to our faces literally said “tip is not included, do you want to tip?” When we were paying to leave. Even in the US that would not have been acceptable. It turned what was an already not so great experience into a poor one.\n\nOut of all the places we went to eat while in Italy, this one was our only regret. Had some cool stuff on the walls but in an empty room where you could have sat us anywhere next to the bathrooms where one of the toilets was clogged and stinky, that was just the icing on the cake."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhDGf-OqLIFPg5yyzd448EFh\u0026fid=0x0:0xa5e2b3ce4d5e550c""],""When"":""2025-12-13""},{""Name"":""Phil McMinn"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocL-C4yq2ID5sNgfA3EVweUKisuy02Nok44n7KD1Ntjab4bdUQ=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Best pizza I’ve had in Italy!

The service was slow and our food came out lukewarm. I rarely complain at restaurants but I asked for them to re-fire our food. It came out a bit better the second time, but we had much better food elsewhere.\n\nMy partner and I ordered a marguerita pizza, the fried artichoke, the pistachio ravioli, and the tiramisu. Everything except for the dessert came all at once, which was weird - we thought we would receive the artichoke first but it came with the mains. By the time we had finished eating the artichoke, the pizza and the pasta were ice cold (they were barely warm when they arrived). The artichoke was fine, it was my first time trying it and I found it really greasy and bland. When we finally received the second round of pizza and pasta (we waited quite a while), they were okay, not mind blowing - the pizza is better than the pasta. However, the tiramisu is an abomination- it was custardy, thick, too sweet, and for some reason yellow in colour. I've never seen anything like it. My family is Italian and so I've had many good tiramisus, and this was so far from what I am used to, I was very disappointed.\n\nThis was one of the few more negative experiences on our two week trip to Italy. We expected a lot better because of all the good reviews but we're also used to a very high level of food service and quality and this restaueant seems to cater to tourists who don't really know what excellent Italian food is like... compared to  Olive Garden, this place is great, but compared to so many other restaurants in Italy, the food is okay at best, expensive for what it is, and the service was not good.\n\nThe only redeeming quality was that there was some live music in the piazza and we were seated outside on a lovely day."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhAvPLlLx4Vj7drKkkjogrjD\u0026fid=0x0:0xccaaaf44d8012132""],""When"":""2025-10-25""},{""Name"":""Lynn T"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjUICE4zCAo2vMyK6qrmAIiydLpnOJ8y1RnD7wY2wSUgjQ25H51w=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Wonderful staircase going underground to more seating.

It turned out to be the perfect choice.\n\nThe rooftop setting is cozy, warm, and inviting, exactly what we needed after a long travel day. The staff was exceptionally kind and welcoming, attentive without being intrusive, and really added to the experience.\n\nThe food was a standout. The pasta carbonara was absolutely amazing rich, creamy, perfectly cooked, and easily one of the best versions we’ve had. And the tiramisu deserves a special mention: it was hands down the best we had in all of Italy during our trip.\n\nPrices were very reasonable, especially considering it’s a hotel restaurant with such a nice atmosphere and high-quality dishes.\n\nOverall, La Fata Ignorante exceeded our expectations and offered the perfect first meal in Rome.

a sandwich shop; it's a charismatic culinary experience that immediately became my favorite in Rome and the second-best I’ve found in all my Italian travels. Tucked away with a small, yet inviting and charming atmosphere, this spot perfectly blends a fresh, modern aesthetic with old-world charm, emphasized by the cured meats hanging on display. It’s the ideal locale for a casual date or catching up with friends over a glass of local wine and a delicious bite.\n\nMy family and I managed to sample a fantastic selection, including the Keep Calm, Bacca Rossa, Williams, and Fico sandwiches, along with the generous Iberico Taglieri (charcuterie board). While everything was undeniably delicious, the Keep Calm and the Fico were the absolute standouts.\nThe Keep Calm is a masterpiece of textural and flavor balance. It masterfully combines Prosciutto cotto with crema di radicchio, stracciatella cheese, cherry tomatoes (pomodorini), and rughetta (arugula). The creaminess of the stracciatella provides a luxurious base that is perfectly cut by the necessary acid from the tomatoes and the sharp, welcome bite of the red radish cream. It’s a composition that truly compliments itself and elevates simple ingredients to an art form.\nNot to be overshadowed, the Fico sandwich was another clear winner, thanks to the star element: the fig. Its rich, sweet flavor was absolutely delicious, providing an unforgettable sweetness that made the whole sandwich sing.\n\nBeyond the food, the service truly sets La Salumeria apart. The guys behind the meat slicers were exceptional—friendly, genuinely willing to help, and clearly passionate about the great food they create.\n\nIf you’re looking for high-quality, perfectly balanced Italian sandwiches and charcuterie in a cozy, beautiful setting, this is the place. We highly recommend swinging by La Salumeria; you won't regret making it your own favorite Roman stop!"",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhC5DkBF9hitQdao-oHe6yGt\u0026fid=0x0:0x8fc050810e1c39c6""],""When"":""2025-10-21""},{""Name"":""Sheila Young"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocJArK2S1LXB2Cpr3yuYjSECyQBmD35ik_9djflP-jbjegIb6KFv=s120-c-rp-mo-ba6-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""We just had the best fresh sandwiches here- with ample glasses of wine.

It is a place that feels both timeless and vibrantly current, a testament to the idea that classic dishes, executed with precision and passion, will always find their appreciative audience.\n\nThe atmosphere strikes a perfect balance: a cozy warmth pervades the dining room, with its polished wood and inviting banquettes, yet there's an undeniable buzz that speaks to its popularity among discerning locals and visitors alike. Service is attentive and knowledgeable, guiding diners through a menu that is a love letter to French gastronomy.\n\nBegin, perhaps, with the Asperges blanches \u0026 sauce hollandaise, a seasonal triumph. The white asparagus, plump and tender, arrived perfectly cooked, their delicate bitterness beautifully complemented by a rich, silken hollandaise that was a marvel of emulsification. It was a simple dish, elevated to an art form.\n\nFor mains, the choices are a celebration of hearty, comforting flavors. The Filet de boeuf, sauce au poivre is a robust and deeply satisfying plate. The beef, cooked to a perfect medium-rare, was fork-tender, its richness cut by a classic, impeccably balanced peppercorn sauce. Equally impressive was the Poulet fermier à la crème \u0026 aux morilles, a dish that transported one straight to the French countryside. The farm-raised chicken was succulent, its earthy flavor amplified by the creamy, intensely mushroom-laden sauce that begged to be sopped up with every last piece of bread. And for those seeking a playful yet indulgent classic, the Cordon bleu de volaille, comté \u0026 jambon delivered in spades. This was no ordinary cordon bleu; the chicken was impeccably tender, encasing a generous, gooey heart of melty Comté and savory ham, all encased in a crisp, golden crust that crackled with each bite.\n\nBistrot Des Tournelles is more than just a meal; it's an experience. It’s a reaffirmation that, in an ever-changing culinary landscape, the soul of French cooking, rooted in quality ingredients and traditional techniques, continues to thrive, offering genuine pleasure and a profound sense of culinary well-being. This is a bistro to bookmark, to return to, and to savor."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhCkO-BcBhodbkhgiASUJkwZ\u0026fid=0x0:0x3786d8da5b343efd""],""When"":""2025-6-27""},{""Name"":""Jan Potts"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/ACg8ocKMmKOhvzGZyPpUIEDAiKixFxLVU235la7ZG5rZA0eVLusdXA=s120-c-rp-mo-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""This was our second time at Bistro des Tournelles.

And at the end, as we were sitting, enjoying a last few minutes chatting with people at the next table, we were presented with the check without requesting it and asked to leave. That was unacceptable especially to my husband who said he’s not certain he wants to return. Given that our meal was over 300 euros and we hadn’t been at the table 2 hours it was very disappointing.

However, at this restaurant, the staff were polite and respectful from start to finish, which made it a rare and truly enjoyable experience with fine dining.\n\nWe started with a welcome snack that had a lovely contrast—crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a fresh taste that stood out. The bread came with butter that was so perfectly salty and rich, I was tempted to ask where they got it from—it was exactly my style.\n\nWith such a strong start, we were excited for the starters and mains we had ordered.\nThe langoustine dish—Langoustine vivant et girolles et chanterelles (€49)—was beautifully presented, with vibrant colours and charming plating on a gorgeous plate I wanted to take home! The only slight letdown was the sauce—it could have used a bit more nuttiness to bring out the best in the dish.\n\nThe sea bass and lamb dishes were visually stunning, with thoughtful plating and creative touches like round slices of courgette and a lovely yellow ingredient in the sauce. The whole presentation felt detailed and playful, and I was genuinely sad to see the food disappear as we ate. The lack of any fishy smell made it all the more perfect.\nThe only downside was that the lamb portion felt a bit small. A few days earlier I had a tough and disappointing lamb dish elsewhere, but this one was tender, flavourful, and came with a sauce that felt almost comforting—like it was making up for that past experience.\n\nOriginally, we hadn’t planned to order dessert as we weren’t that hungry, but one of my friends insisted—and it turned out to be delicious. After seeing the desserts at the table next to us, we even considered ordering more, wondering if we could manage despite being full.\nI’m usually not one for desserts, and often just take one bite to satisfy my curiosity, but this time I decided to wait for another visit and end the meal on a high note—with a great view and even better service.\n\nThe prices are higher than at a typical restaurant, but for the view, the quality of the service, and the food itself—I would definitely recommend it."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhBeHpJhq4Ke5rzN6Zq9luje\u0026fid=0x0:0x6568bfb659691796""],""When"":""2025-8-2""},{""Name"":""Mark Harvey"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjV1uBUXRFIZYKZMclLbQl-Wiuec5S6Z91r5k4mHtHQHNGmrSZvh=s120-c-rp-mo-ba2-br100"",""Rating"":5,""Description"":""Excellent food and outstanding service!

The dough was too soft and squishy, and the slice couldnt even hold up on my hand. It was just overall lacking in that body and crunch. The flavours were quite nice though.\n\nFinally, the tiramisu was the absolute worst thing we had. The ladyfingers were so bland and had no coffee taste no alcohol nothing.

Both meals were cooked individually in their own cast iron pots.   Consequently, they came out quickly and were lovely and hot.

discovered LouLou on the final day of my trip to Paris, and I wish I had discovered it sooner! Pretty much the entire menu can be made gluten-free, and I was spoilt for choice; if I had stayed longer, I would have liked to return to try many dishes. In the end, I went for the fish and chips.  The location is a short walk away from Notre Dame and Pantheon with Metro access nearby, but it is worth making a special trip to visit, especially if you are gluten-free.\n\nThe food was really good, it was super tasty and fresh, the batter was crispy, and the fish was of very good quality. The salad was good, especially with the dressing, and I also liked the pureed peas too which elevated the dish. Portion size was slightly small, especially for the price, but I did enjoy my food. I did find this place to be a little pricey, with my food coming to €30, there was also a small fee for paying via the QR code, so I opted to pay with a waitress instead.\n\nFor my drink, I went for the orange iced tea. I wasn’t a huge fan of this as it was slightly bitter, but again, it was fresh, and garnished with a generous chunk of lemon.\n\nThe staff were friendly, although I would have liked them to repeat gluten-free back to me so I felt more confident and relaxed eating here. The overall ambience was pretty comfortable and relaxed; it felt like a casual vibe yet with high-quality food."",""Images"":[""www.google.com/local/imagery/report/?cb_client=maps_sv.tactile\u0026image_key=!1e10!2sCIABIhBYV0SxezryIYC-N6qUOwbY\u0026fid=0x0:0x31d8bafe75893cec""],""When"":""2025-12-14""},{""Name"":""Anannya Roy Sen"",""ProfilePicture"":""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXQuVRi7RX2u7c3bRE6vviTh0Z1pJaP9Oyw9WiUziiWE34IP3gKCQ=s120-c-rp-mo-ba4-br100"",""Rating"":4,""Description"":""We showed up at Loulou without a reservation on a cold, rainy Sunday morning.
